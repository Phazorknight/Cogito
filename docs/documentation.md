# Intro to COGITO
COGITO is a fully featured template. It is recommended to use this as the starting point of your project BEFORE implementing any of your own features.
We strongly recommend playing through the included demo scenes to get a good impression of what functionality is included. While COGITO is designed with modularity and versatility in mind, it is usually easier to modify the included systems than try to make it work with other external systems (like using a different inventory system or player controller).
The most common tasks most users will run into is adapting their own assets and levels to work with COGITO. I'm in the process of creating video tutorials for these cases which should help you get started quickly.


## COGITO Setup
1. Clone this repo or download it and unzip it into it's own directory.
2. Open the project with the Godot editor.
3. Make sure the following plug-ins are activated:
  - Quick Audio (currently v1.0)
  - Input Helper (currently v4.2.2)
4. Make sure the following Autoloads are set up in your project:
  - res://COGITO/EsayMenus/Nodes/menu_template_manager.tscn
  - res://COGITO/SceneManagement/cogito_scene_manager.gd
  - res://COGITO/QuestSysteemPD/CogitoQuestManager.gd
5. Open and run **res://COGITO/DemoScenes/COGITO_04_Demo_Lobby.tscn** to see if everything works.


## Basic Game Scene Setup
** Update: You now only need to place your Player.tscn inside your scene. The Player_HUD and PauseMenu have been moved inside the Player.tscn.**
Please note that you still need to hook up your references inside the player scene (though they should be hooked up by default).

To enable transitioning between scenes, your scene root node needs to have cogito_scene.gd attached and connector nodes defined (see demo scene). You can read more about this in [Scene Transitions](#scene_transitions).


# Player Controller
COGITO includes a first person player controller that has a variety of parameters and settings built-in. We recommend just reading through the descriptions and tweaking the parameters to your liking.
Most common adjustments needed are walking, running and sprinting speeds, stair handling, ladder handling. Be aware that a few of the player controller parameters will be controlled by the game options and are thus user controlled (for example Invert Y Axis).


# Cogito Attributes
Cogito Attributes are a custom class used to save and manipulate  data most commonly used to represent some kind of numerical attribute. Most common examples are values like health points, stamina, magic, etc. These are usually tied to the player but not exclusively. For example you can use the health attribute on any objects that you want to receive damage. The included specific attributes come as component nodes you can simply instantiate as child nodes to any object.

## CogitoAttribute base class
The base class used for any attributes is the CogitoAttribute class.

Properties:
  - **attribute_name** (String)
	- String used in scripts to find specific attributes. Make sure this is all lowercase and without spaces.
  - **attribute_display_name** (String)
	- As it would appear in the game.
  - **attribute_color** (Color)
	- Used for UI elements
  - **attribute_icon** (Texture2D)
	- Used for UI elements
  - **value_max** (float)
	- The maximum value of this attribute. Can change over time and is saved in the player state file.
  - **value_start** (float)
	- The start value of this attribute.
	  
Signals:
  - **attribute_changed**(attribute_name: String, value_current: float, value_max: float, has_increased: bool)
	- Gets emitted anytime the attribute value changes. If the value change was positive, has_increased will be true, if not it's false)
  - **attribute_reached_zero**(attribute_name: String, value_current: float, value_max: float)
	- Gets emitted when the current value of this attribute is 0.


## Health Attribute
This attribute is not just for player health. You can attach the component to objects to give them their own "health" and define behaviour when they run out of health (death).

Properties:
  - **no_sanity_damage** (float)
	- used in combination with the sanity attribute. Defines how much damage per second the owner takes if their sanity attribute has reached zero.
  - **sound_on_damage** (AudioStream)
	- AudioStream that plays when the owner takes damage.
  - **sound_on_death** (AudioStream)
	- AudioStream that plays when the owner dies (health reaches zero).
  - **destroy_on_death** (Array[NodePath])
	- When the owner dies, all the nodes which nodepaths are in this array will get destroyed (queue_free())
  - **spawn_on_death** (PackedScene)
	- When the owner dies, the packed scene will be instantiate at the owners global position. This is most commonly used for VFX or item drops.

Signals:
  - **damage_taken**()
	- Gets emitted when the owner takes damage (attribute value decreases). Can be used for VFX, audio.
  - **death**()
	- Gets emitted when the owner dies. Can be used for VFX, audio, triggering cutscenes, updating quests, etc.


## Stamina Attribute
**Tip: If you don't want to use the Stamina system, simply remove the StaminaAttribute from your Player scene.**
This attribute works in tight connection with the Player controller. When in use, certain actions from the player will consume stamina and player movement will be limited once the stamina is fully depleted. The default actions that are affected by Stamina is sprinting and jumping.

Properties:
  - **stamina_regen_speed** (float)
	- How fast stamina regenerates in points per second.
  - **run_exhaustion_speed** (float)
	- How fast sprinting reduces stamina in points per seconds of sprinting.
  - **jump_exhaustion** (float)
	- How much stamina jumping consumes in points.
  - **regenerate_after** (float)
	- The delay after using the last stamina-consuming action before stamina starts regenerating, in seconds.
  - **auto_regenerate** (float)
	- If turned off, stamina will not auto regenerate.


## Visibility Attribute
**Tip: If you don't want to use the Visibility system, simply remove the VisibilityAttribute from your Player scene.** 
(This used to be called Brightness component).
The Visibility Attribute represents how "visible" the player is within a scene. It is important to understand that this attribute is not actually tied to Lights within your scene. Instead, it works by counting how many Lightzones the player is currently in, which are their own component. This was decided to give developers the best control on how visible the player is at any spot inside a level.
This attribute can then be checked by other entities, whenever they have a reference to the player. A common example would be that if the player enters the viewcone of a NPC, you might still want the NPC to not detect the player if they're shrouded in complete darkness, or detect the player faster, the higher their visibility is.


## Light Meter Attribute
This new attribute actually measures how much light the player is exposed to by checking the average luminance of the current player position.
As this heavily depends on your scene, you will most likely need to tweak the min/max values within this attribute and it's script.
Please note that this calculation is somewhat performance hungry, so use with caution.


## Sanity Attribute
(work in progress)

## UI Attribute Component
This packaged scene is used to reperesent attributes in the Player HUD. In the default COGITO Setup, the Player HUD checks which attribute nodes are part of the Player scene and instantiated a UI Attribute Component for each one in the Attribute Container.

The UI Attribute Component reads all properties and connects to all signals needed directly from the Attribute itself (color, icon, name, values).
You can customize the component to fit your own needs. Alterantively, you can also define explicit attribute components for each attribute if you create a direct reference in the PlayerHUD script (this involves some coding).
To change where the Attribute UIs show, change the location of the PlayerAttributes PanelContainer.


# Player Interaction System
COGITO works with a raycast interaction system. This means that the player camera contains a raycast3d that constantly checks what the player is looking at. If an interactive object is detected, the raycast checks what kind of interaction components are attached to the object and displays interaction prompts accordingly.

 # Cogito Objects
Cogito Objects refers to classes specifcally created to work with all of COGITO's systems. These are designed to represent the most commonly used interactive objects in games. Below you'll find a brief explanation what each object does so you know which one to choose when you want to turn your own asset into a suitable Cogito Object.
Interactables consider of two major parts: The object itself and the InteractionComponents attached as child nodes to define what kind of interactions can be done.

Here's a quick overview which object to use for what use-case:
| Cogito Object/Script  | Use case |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cogito_Object | Item pick-ups, props, crates, "clutter objects" |
| Cogito_Door | Doors, gates, manually controlled platforms, bridges, moveable objects with two positions (open/closed)  |
| Cogito_Button | Button that unlocks a door (single-use), vending machine buttons (repeated-use)  |
| Cogito_Switch | Lamps, levers, sockets for key objects, objects with two states (on/off) |
| Cogito_Keypad | Keypads, other UI based minigames that should send signals. |
| Cogito_Turnwheel | Valves, rotation-based levers, press-and-hold interactions |
| Cogito_StaticInteractable | Static objects who's state won't get saved that still can have interactions attached. |


## Cogito_Object
This is the basis of most smaller interactive objects. Item pickups, crates, and common "clutter objects" would utilize this.
Use a Cogito_Object if you want to do any of the following:
 - You want the object to be moved around within the level scene (Cogito_Object saves position and rotation, works well with RigidBodies)
 - You want to use a variety of included interactions (most other objects have bespoke interactions, Cogito_Object is made to use a mix of interaction components)
 - This object might not always exist in the level scene (Cogito_Object are based on PackedScenes and sometimes get instanced on runtime, COGITO also saves if a Cogito_Object exists in a scene or not)

## Cogito_Door
Naturally, this object is perfect for doors, but it can actually be used for anything that is supposed to move based on player interaction or other Cogito Objects.
If you have an object that transitions between two positions, then the Cogito_Door object is the one to use. It also includes options to be "locked" and to require a key_item to be unlocked.
Cogito_Doors also don't have to be purely triggered by direct player interactions: Cogito_Doors can be controlled by other Cogito Objects or via signals.
To learn how to set up a Cogito Door from scratch, check out [COGITO - Tutorial: Sliding door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBSxqjXlWY).

## Cogito_Button
The Cogito_Button is used to trigger other objects via signal or to call interact() on other Cogito objects. It can be set to be "one-time-use" and also has "re-use" delay to avoid spamming.

## Cogito_Switch
Similar to the Cogito_Button but with a few more functions. This is used to create interactive objects with a clear on/off or A/B state. Most common examples are lamps and lights. It uses 3 node arrays that will be switched depending on their state: nodes that will be shown when ON, nodes that will be hidden when ON, and nodes that will have interact() called on switch use. You can also set if the switch can be used repeatedly or not, if using the switch requires an item, and of course your custom interaction texts. Included signals can also help triggering additional behaviours, like playing an animation.
PRO-TIP: The objects you switch do not have to be part of the switchable object. For example if you wanna have a ceiling lamp that is controlled by a light switch, make the light switch the switchable and add all the ceiling lamps to the objects to switch list.

## Cogito_Keypad
This classic Keypad works exactly as you expect. The included PackedScene includes it's own GUI, which can be easily customized.
The Cogito_Keypad includes exposed references to work with Cogito_Doors, but you can also set them to trigger other objects by using the included signals.

## Cogito_Turnwheel
With this you can create most common "press and hold" interaction that involve turning an object, like a valve. Is made to work with a HoldInteraction component.
This object includes settings for rotation axis and speed as well as an AudioStream to play while being rotated.
It also includes an exposed reference to trigger other nodes (most commonly used for doors).

## Cogito_StaticInteractable
This object is used for Objects that do not need to save any information for persistency or saving/loading. Mind you that the object itself doesn't have to be strictly static. This is most commonly used for very generic environment interactables, like a poster on the wall that will have a Readable component, or a pinwheel that can be spun via an interaction.



# Cogito Inventory System

The inventory system is largely resource based. The inventory system and the inventory UI are independent form each other. UI elements get updated via signals.

### Inventory Overview
The Inventory System contains of 3 main resources:
Items -> Slots -> Inventories.

- Inventory item: Resource that contains all the parameters pertaining to a specific item. Has sub-catgeories like WieldableItem, ConsumableItem etc.
- Slot: The "container" for an item and manages stuff like item stacks, moving items, dropping items, etc.
- Inventory: This resource is a collection of slots. Can vary in size. Per default, the Player has an inventory attached. Also used for containers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It is helpful to understand what the documentation refers to when using the words "item" and "pick up"
>- Item = this always refers to the Resource file, based on the Inventory Item class.
>- Pick up = this is how the item exists in the 3D world, usually as a Cogito_Object with a pick_up component attached.
>- Usually the two reference each other: Cogito_Object with Pickup_component <-> Inventory Item resource

**Note: Make sure that the Slot Data resource on your pick up is set to "Local to Scene ON", especially on stackable items. If not, instances of this item will share the same slot resource, causing wrongly calculated item quantities.**

### Inventory Item Class
This is the base class of all Inventory Items. Contains information that is common to all item types, such as name, descrption, stack size, etc.
If you want to create your own item type, it is strongly recommended to inherit from this class.



# Game persistence, saving and loading

This information will help you understand when and what kind of data is loaded and saved.
If you run into any issues with scene persistence not behaving as you might expect, this video might point you in the right direction.


## Save data overview

Cogito uses custom resources for saving. These resources are called states.
The state file contains all information that Cogito saves, usually tied to a profile or save slot.

There are two types of state files: Player states and Scene states. Separating this has pros and cons. Knowing these can help you to understand any issues you might run into, as well as changing what doesn’t work for you.

Pros:
- Player state is completely game scene independent.
- Easier to customize what kind of data is saved.
- Scene states don’t need to “know” of other scene states.
- When the player saves/loads a game, only necessary data is saved or loaded, improving load times.
- Avoids save file bloat.

Cons:
- File management: As save data is split up between different state files, more file management actions need to be taken for each operation.
- Old/misaligned state files can create unexpected behavior or reduced compatibility when updating/changing the player or scenes.


## Player state
The player state contains all data tied to the player:
- Player position in game scene
- Player rotation in game scene
- Game scene the player was in when the state was saved (name as well as path)
- Player attributes (current value and max value)
- Player inventory
- Player quests (active, failed, completed)

**When is the player state saved?**
- A player state is saved when the game save is triggered manually. The save file created is saved in the user directory and is tied to the currently active save slot.
- A temporary player state is also saved when the player transitions from one scene to another scene. This state is saved on exit of the first scene, and loaded when entering the new scene, as to maintain player data consistency.

**When is the player state loaded?**
- A player state is loaded when the player loads a saved game manually. It is tied to the currently active save slot.
- If the player is transitioning from one scene to another, then the temporarily created player state is loaded, with some data like player position and rotation being overwritten by the scene connector.


## Scene state
The scene state contains all data relevant for proper persistence of the game scene. Usually you’d have a scene state file for each save slot and game scene present (for example, if your game has 10 game scenes, and 3 save slots, you’d potentially have 30 scene states, 10 scene states for each save slot).

The scene state contains the following data:
- All objects:
  - Position
  - Rotation

- Cogito Object:
  - Position
  - Rotation
  - Parent node path (for instantiation)
  - Packed scene file path (for instantiation)
  - Child interaction nodes (for object data)

- Cogito Door:
  - Is locked/unlocked
  - Is open/closed

- Cogito Switch:
  - Is on/off
- Cogito Button:
  - has been used
- Cogito Turnwheel:
  - has been turned
- Cogito Keypad:
  - is locked/unlocked

**When is the scene state saved?**
- The scene state of the currently active game scene is saved when the player manually triggers the game save (usually from the menu). This only saves the state of the currently active scene (TODO: look into this more if the player transitions through multiple scenes)
- The scene state is saved as a temporary state as soon as the player leaves the scene to transition to a different one. This is used to keep scene persistency if the player later returns to this scene.

**When is the scene state loaded?**
- When the player loads a saved game, the scene as well as it’s state that is referenced in the player state is loaded. This works by checking if the player is currently in the scene that the player state has saved as the players location. If NOT, the game transitions to said scene and only then loads the player state and scene state.
- If it exists, a temporary scene state is loaded when the player transitions into a scene. This is used to keep scene persistency, if the player is returning to this scene when they were previously in it. If no temporary scene state is found, the default scene is loaded.



# FAQ

### My question isn't answered here?
- If you have a feature request, please post in the Discussions page on the GitHub repo.
- If you have found a bug, please create an Issue on the GitHub issue page.
- This FAQ is still a work in progress, but I try to add answers to the most common questions as they come up.

### How do I set the main menu to start/load my own level scene?
- Open the main_menu.tscn and find the MainMenu_SaveSlotManager node. There you can set a path to the scene you want to load first when a new game is started.
![COGITO_ChangeGameScene](cog_ChangeGameScene.JPG)

### My own objects aren't working!
There are a few reasons for them to not be working, so here's a checklist:
- Make sure your interactive object has a CollisionShape3D and is set to the right layers.
- Make sure your interactive object is a Cogito_Object or similar (Cogito Door). This is necessary for Cogito's interaction system to pick it up.
- Make sure you have interaciton components attached to the root node of your object. Use a default included component to make sure it works (CarryableComponent is the quickest)
- Make sure your object is saved as it's own scene. It is not strictly necessary for all object-types, but can help with some issues.


### --- OLD DOCUMENTATION BEYOND THIS POINT ---

### PickupComponent
Use this component to create items that are added to the players inventory.
I usually create this _before_ I create the item resource, but it doesn't matter, as long as the references are set.

The basic idea is this:
Pick up = this is how the item exists in the 3D world.
Item = this is how it exists within the inventory system.

The two reference each other: Packed Scene <-> Inventory Item resource
**Note: Make sure that the Slot Data resource on your pick up is set to "Local to Scene ON", especially on stackable items. If not, instances of this item will share the same slot resource, causing wrongly calculated item quantities.**
