COGITO is a first Person Immersive Sim Template Project for Godot Engine 4. 
In comparison to other first person assets out there, which focus mostly on shooter mechanics, COGITO focuses on providing a framework for creating interactable objects and environments.


COGITO is made by `Philip Drobar <https://www.philipdrobar.com>`_ with help from `these contributors <https://github.com/Phazorknight/Cogito/graphs/contributors>`_.
