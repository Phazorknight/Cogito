Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

.. tip::
   It is strongly recommended to use the COGITO Project as your base Godot project, as it comes with a few pre-configured settings like Input Maps and Autoloads. After installation, you can import your own assets and get started making your game.

Installation steps:

#. Clone this repo or download it and unzip it into its own directory.
#. Open the project with the Godot editor (make sure you use a compatible version, currently 4.2.1)


Setup
-----

If you've used the COGITO Project as the base for your own project, you shouldn't have to do much else to get it running. But just in case here's some how it should be set up:

Make sure the following plugins are activated:
* Quick Audio (currently v1.0)
* Input Helper (currently v4.2.2)
* Also make sure the following Autoloads are set up in your project:

   * res://COGITO/EsayMenus/Nodes/menu_template_manager.tscn
   * res://COGITO/SceneManagement/cogito_scene_manager.gd
   * res://COGITO/QuestSysteem/cogito_quest_manager.gd

Make sure that the Main Scene is set to ``res://COGITO/DemoScenes/COGITO_0_MainMenu.tscn``. This is not strictly necessary, but will make sure the Demo project runs as expected.


Running the Demo scenes
-----------------------

* You can find all included Demo scenes within ``/COGITO/DemoScenes/`` but if you've followed the steps above you can also just run the project by pressing ``F5`` and it should start at the Main Menu.
* You can also run the ``Lobby`` or the ``Laboratory`` scenes directly and explore.

Feel free to explore the Demo scenes to discover everything COGITO has to offer!


How COGITO works in 60 seconds
------------------------------

Here's all you need to know in as little words as possible.

Level scenes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You only need the ``cogito_player.tscn`` in your scene to run. It includes the HUD and pause menu as child scenes.
The root node of your level scene needs to have ``cogito_scene.gd`` attached. If you want to transition between scenes, you need to define connector nodes in the inspector.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~
A lot of parts of COGITO heavily applies the component design pattern. This means that most functions are organized in a way where you will have a root node of an object, and can add or remove several child nodes as *Components* to change the object's behavior.
For example:
* Player scene has Attributes as child nodes.
* Cogito Objects have InteractionComponents as child nodes.

and many more.

Common object types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COGITO includes a number of common object scripts which define an objects behavior.
When you create your game, a common workflow would look like this:
#. Create a new scene (usually a Node3D)
#. Create / import an asset (like a door mesh)
#. Add the imported mesh to your new scene. (MeshInstance of the door + collider)
#. Attach the script with the desired behavior to the scene root node (for the door we'd use ``cogito_door.gd``)
#. Set the desired behavior in the Inspector
#. Add any additional nodes or components (the door requires a BasicInteraction component as a child node)
#. Save packed scene.

Voil√†, you can now place the door in your level scenes and it should work.
You can read more about them in the manual under *Cogito Objects*.
