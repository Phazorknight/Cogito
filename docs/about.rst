Welcome to COGITO
-----------------
COGITO is a first Person Immersive Sim Template Project for Godot Engine 4. 
In comparison to other first person assets out there, which focus mostly on shooter mechanics, COGITO focuses on providing a framework for creating interactable objects and environments.

COGITO is a fully featured template. It is recommended to use this as the starting point of your project BEFORE implementing any of your own features. We strongly recommend playing through the included demo scenes to get a good impression of what functionality is included. While COGITO is designed with modularity and versatility in mind, it is usually easier to modify the included systems than try to make it work with other external systems (like using a different inventory system or player controller). The most common tasks most users will run into is adapting their own assets and levels to work with COGITO. I'm in the process of creating video tutorials for these cases, which should help you get started quickly.

Guiding principles
------------------
The structure of this template always tries to adhere to the following principles:

* **Complete:** When you download COGITO and press play, you get a functioning project out of the box. Game menu, save slot select, options and a playable level are all included.
* **Versatile:** Whether your game is set in the future, the past, or the present, uses melee, projectile or no weapons at all, has low poly, stylized or realistic graphics, the template will have features for you.
* **Modular:** Don't want to use a feature? You will be able to hide it, ignore it or strip it out without breaking COGITO. At the same time, COGITO is designed to be extendable with your own custom features or other add-ons.
* **Approachable:** While there will always be a learning curve, we strive to make COGTIO approachable and intuitive to use, so it doesn't get in your way of making your game.

Current Features
----------------

   * Sprinting, jumping, crouching, sliding, stairs handling, ladder handling

* Systemic Properties
