Principals of this Template
===========================
The structure of this template always tries to adhere to the following principles:

* **Complete:** When you download COGITO and press play, you get a functioning project out of the box. Game menu, save slot select, options and a playable level are all included.
* **Versatile:** Wether your game is set in the future, the past or the present, uses melee, projectile or no weapons at all, has low poly, stylized or realistic graphics, the template will have features for you.
* **Modular:** Don't want to use a feature? You will be able to hide it, ignore it or strip it out without breaking COGITO. At the same time, COGITO is designed to be extendable with your own custom features or other add-ons.
* **Approachable:** While there will always be a learning curve, we strive to make COGTIO approachable and intuitive to use, so it doesn't get in your way of making your game.
